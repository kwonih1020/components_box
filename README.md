# 아토믹 디자인

## Atom

더이상 분해할 수 없는 기본 컴포넌트를 의미. (ex: Label, Input, Button)과 같이 기본 HTML Element 태그 혹은 글꼴, 애니메이션, 컬러 팔레트, 레이아웃과 같이 추상적인 요소도 포함

## Molecule

Molecule는 여러 개의 atom을 결합하여 자신의 고유한 특성을 가짐.
예를 들어서, Input & Button 을 결합하여 Form을 molecule로 정의 할 수 있음.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
